Swiatek won her final 11 matches of the season en route to titles at WTA 1000 Beijing and the WTA Finals, marking the first time since 2009 that the No.1 ranking changed hands at the year-end championships. </p>\n<p><a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/3772009/a-wta-finals-champ-the-world-no-1-and-another-iga-swiatek-masterclass"><em><strong>The WTA Finals champ, the World No.1 and another Iga Swiatek masterclass</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>In 17 Tour-level events (not including United Cup which does not crown an individual title winner), Swiatek reached the semifinals 12 times and also advanced to finish as runner-up at two WTA 1000 tournaments – Dubai and Madrid – winning a Tour-leading six titles. </p>\n<p>Swiatek returns to the top of the WTA Rankings for the first time since holding the World No.1 ranking for 75 consecutive weeks. At 22 years old, she becomes the sixth youngest player in Tour history to finish the year at No.1 in consecutive seasons, followed by Chris Evert, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and Caroline Wozniacki.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n\n\n</div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About the year-end Top 10</strong></span></p>\n<p>Swiatek’s end of season move to No.1 pushes Aryna Sabalenka to No.2 in the final rankings. Swiatek and Sabalenka are the only two players to hold the WTA World No.1 this season; Sabalenka held the No.1 ranking for eight weeks. </p>\n<p>They are joined by No.3 Coco Gauff, No.4 Elena Rybakina, No.5 Jessica Pegula, No.6 Ons Jabeur, No.7 Marketa Vondrousova, No.8 Karolina Muchova, No.9 Maria Sakkari and No.10 Barbora Krejcikova.</p>\n<p>A quick look at a breakdown of the year-end Top 10:</p>\n<p>•    Youngest: Coco Gauff, 19<br />•    Oldest: Jessica Pegula, 29<br />•    The Top 10 combined to win 23 singles titles in 2023 and have combined to win 62 titles across their respective careers</p>\n<p><strong>Four straight for Sabalenka:</strong> This year marks the fourth consecutive Top 10 finish for Sabalenka, the longest active streak. Sabalenka has been ranked in the Top 10 every week since November 16, 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Czech trio:</strong> For the first time since the WTA Rankings were introduced, three Czech women finished in the year-end Top 10 – Vondrousova, Muchova and Krejcikova. There has been at least one Czech woman in the year-end Top 10 in 12 of the last 13 years -- since 2011, with the exception of 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>Americans in Top 10:</strong> Gauff is the first American teenager to finish in the year-end Top 10 in consecutive years since Serena Williams (1999, 2000). This year marks the first time that two Americans have finished in the year-end Top 5 since 2010, when Serena Williams and Venus Williams finished at No.4 and No.5 respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Greek streak:</strong> Sakkari finishes the year in the Top 10 for the third consecutive year. She has maintained her Top 10 ranking since making her debut on September 27, 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Big leaps lead to first-time Top 10 finishes:</strong> Muchova, Rybakina and Vondrousova are all finishing in the year-end Top 10 for the first time in their careers. They also represent the biggest jumps in the Top 10 from last year’s year-end ranking. Muchova finished 2022 season ranked No.149 (+141 improvement), while Vondrousova improved her year-end ranking 92 spots (from No.99 to No.7) and Rybakina improved 18 spots (from No.22 to No.4). </p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Doubles year-end No.1</strong></span></p>\n<p>Storm Hunter finishes the year at No.1 in doubles, becoming the second Australian woman to end the season in the top spot in doubles after Samantha Stosur in 2006. Hunter is the third Australian woman overall to rise to the No.1 doubles spot, with Rennae Stubbs also reaching the pinnacle of the doubles rankings.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Top 100 debuts of 2023</strong></span></p>\n<p>Sixteen players broke the Top 100 for the first time in 2023, including eight Americans, two Spaniards, one Briton and one Australian.

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva were in Cancun for a good time. They left with something to remember after winning the doubles title at the GNP Seguros WTA Finals. </p>\n<p>The story writes itself. Zvonareva\'s first foray at the WTA Finals came 18 years ago, when she qualified for the doubles tournament with Elena Likhovtseva. Now 39, she nearly hung up her racquets last year after an Achilles injury.</p>\n<p>But after a season-ending push that required a title run in Nanchang to seal their spot in Cancun, the former World No.2 said this trophy will go down as one of her most meaningful.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>"This year was probably the first year in my career where I really focused on doubles," Zvonareva said. "Actually going all the way, qualifying here first, and then winning the whole event, it\'s very special. I won a couple of Grand Slam titles in the past and a couple of big tournaments as well, but this is a special event. </p>\n<p>"I don\'t think I\'m realizing it at the moment, but when I get the chance to look back at my whole career and you like you can pinpoint the results that you have in your mind, this will be one of them. It\'s one of the biggest achievements in my career."</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n\n\n</div><p>Siegemund came into this season treating it as a transition year to doubles. An accomplished singles player, the German had seen her ranking plummet after injury. At 35, the writing was on the wall. It was going to be an uphill battle to remain a viable singles player.</p>\n<p>"So my big goal was to become Top 10 In doubles, not necessarily this year, just in general in my career," Siegemund said. "That was one I ticked off this year, so I was really happy about that. Then I did break back into the Top 100 in singles, which is an amazing achievement for me. And it was always also for my career a huge goal to make it to the WTA Finals. </p>\n<p>"Now we are here and we won the whole thing, which was really not on the list. We were taking it easy and enjoying. I never thought we would come home with the trophy. It\'s just a big cherry on the cake."</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Feeling the love in Cancun 🫶<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun</a> <a href="https://t.co/3GsHtyq6eQ">pic.twitter.com/3GsHtyq6eQ</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1721629226455933098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Even though they were one of the last teams to qualify, the pressure to win through the end of the season was precisely what made them the perfect foils in Cancun. While the higher-seeded teams qualified earlier and could coast through the end of the year, Siegemund and Zvonareva were battle-tested. Once they made the US Open final to put themselves on the qualifying bubble, the duo played under pressure through the Asian swing.</p>\n<p>"After the Nanchang final, I thought this is exactly the situations we\'re going to be in repetitively, especially with this No-Ad scoring, where you just like every two minutes you play a big point against the good teams," Siegemund said. "You have zero margin, and I thought that\'s actually good practice."</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="ro">The MOMENT 💜<a href="https://twitter.com/laurasiegemund?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@laurasiegemund</a> and Vera Zvonareva defeat Melichar-Martinez/Perez in straight sets 6-4, 6-4. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun</a> <a href="https://t.co/1DRDTi9o5k">pic.twitter.com/1DRDTi9o5k</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1721627336523526549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Zvonareva agreed. Their ability to adapt and adjust throughout the week in Cancun was the key to their win. </p>\n<p>"Every day, different outcomes and different situations," Zvonareva said. "We had to find our game and say, \'OK, that\'s how it\'s going today. What can we do about it? This is how it\'s going on another day. What can we do about it?\' </p>\n<p>"We created even more of this team spirit, solving the problems on the court. We didn\'t need to play our best tennis to win matches and that\'s something that makes good players great."</p>\n<p>What it means for next year is still anyone\'s guess. Both players know how fleeting health and results can be. For now, it\'s just about soaking in the moment. </p>\n<p>"I take it one week at a time," Zvonareva said. "I don\'t know what\'s going to happen. I\'ve had a lot of injuries. After last year, after Miami, I had to stop for quite a long time as well. You never know what\'s going to happen. </p>\n<p>"So, honestly, I don\'t know. One week at a time and that\'s it. But I\'m really happy to be here today and have this trophy." </p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- How do you top a season that\'s already rewritten the record books?</p>\n<p>For Iga Swiatek, you don’t. Or perhaps, you do.</p>\n<p>Last year, Swiatek famously ran off with 37 straight wins, more than anyone else this century. She had no competition for her No.1 ranking and, quite frankly, was in a league of her own.</p>\n<p>But then this year happened. In September, her 75-week run as the No.1 player came to an end after the US Open. Swiatek was visibly shaken. It turned out the downturn hurt more than she had let on. Afterward, she said all the right things. She was in no rush to take the No.1 back from Aryna Sabalenka. Her focus was to play more freely, to improve herself -- as a player and a person. If she did that, the top ranking would return.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>And it did. On Monday, she finished off another ridiculous stretch. A day after routing Sabalenka, Swiatek dropped only a game against Jessica Pegula in the championship match of this year’s WTA Finals. Altogether, Swiatek did not drop a set in Cancun -- this against the best competition in the world.</p>\n<p>"2022 was so amazing that I don\'t know if it\'s gonna be possible for me to repeat a season like that," Swiatek said. "So I just didn\'t feel at the end like I\'m in the shadow anymore because I knew that I\'m having another great season. And honestly, I kind of accepted that I\'m not going to have a season like that, like in 2022, and I just looked forward."</p>\n<p>Dating back to Tokyo, her first event after the US Open, Swiatek went on to win 12 of her last 13 matches to finish the year. She rolled to the title in Beijing. Then in Cancun, knowing she would likely need to run the table to have a chance at No.1, she became a wrecking ball.</p>\n<p>"I learned my lesson and this time I didn\'t want [the No.1 ranking] to have an impact on me," Swiatek said. "It did a little bit -- it\'s hard not to think about stuff like that -- but actually, when I went on court, I knew that I had to focus on different things. And actually, the conditions here that were kind of tricky, also helped me to just focus on my footwork, my shots, and that just kept me busy from thinking about all of that."</p>\n<p>Against Sabalenka in the semifinals, Swiatek put in one of the most emphatic matches of her career to win 6-3, 6-2. She then outdid that with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Pegula, a player who beat her twice this season. Swiatek bested the marks set by Martina Navratilova in 1983 and Kim Clijsters in 2003 (both of whom lost two) for the fewest games conceded in a WTA Finals title match.</p>\n<p>"She\'s been, in my mind, the one to beat the last couple years,” Pegula said. “She\'s showing that even when she loses some matches or doesn\'t win the tournament, that she\'s still bouncing right back and is playing at a high level every single week.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">✨ best believe I\'m still bejeweled ✨ <a href="https://t.co/YBz4HjyAXh">pic.twitter.com/YBz4HjyAXh</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1721675413456298219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>"That\'s what a top player does, what a champion does, and I think she showed that."</p>\n<p>And with that, Swiatek put an exclamation point on her 2023 season by completing the most dominant run in the year-end championships since the round-robin format was reintroduced in 2003. It was a fitting end for the player with more wins, titles and victories over Top 10 opponents than anyone on tour.</p>\n<p>To appreciate what Swiatek has done not just in 2023, but in her back-to-back seasons, look at the company she keeps in the stat books.</p>\n<p><strong>The stats that matter:</strong></p>\n<p>20: Number of games lost by Swiatek across five matches in Cancun, the fewest games lost since the round-robin format was reintroduced in 2003.

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Iga Swiatek swept past Jessica Pegula with a commanding 6-1, 6-0 victory to clinch the GNP Seguros WTA Finals Cancun title. Monday\'s win ensures Swiatek will surpass Aryna Sabalenka to finish as the year-end No.1 for the second straight season.</p>\n<p>"Coming back to world number one, it\'s a dream come true, for sure," Swiatek said. "I would say I wasn\'t expecting that right now, this season. I was hoping that maybe next year is gonna be my year, but it seems like you know, just working hard and focusing on the right things at the end worked. So I\'m really happy."</p>\n<p>Since falling in the Round of 16 at the US Open, where she initially conceded her No.1 ranking, Swiatek has been on a tear. With titles in Beijing and now Cancun, she has won 12 of 13 matches, including 11 straight. </p>\n<p>During this stretch, Swiatek has lost only one set, a 95.2% success rate. Including her dominant win versus Pegula, Swiatek also won 71.2% of her games during this period. She has saved 11 of 24 break-points opportunities, while converted 54 of 92.</p>\n<p>Swiatek, who captured her tour-leading six title of the season and the 17th of her career, lost just 20 games in Cancun, the most dominant run to the WTA Finals title -- by a longshot -- since the round-robin format was reintroduced in 2003. The previous benchmark was held by Serena Williams who conceded 32 games in 2012.  </p>\n<p>Facing Pegula for a fourth time this season, Swiatek, 22, held the overall head-to-head record at 5-3, but the American had beaten her twice this year. Swiatek captured her first title of the season in Doha by dropping only three games to Pegula in the final. She would capture her last title of the season by losing one.</p><div class="articleWidget center"><div class="embeddable-widget">\n    <div data-fek-settings=\'{"primaryColour":"#000000"}\'></div>\n    <div data-fek-poll="d35cfce6-44a3-457a-a6ac-b0a6624e4f22" id="fek-d35cfce6-44a3-457a-a6ac-b0a6624e4f22"></div><script async src="https://sdk.fek.pulselive.com/fek-sdk-client-web/latest/client.min.js"></script>\n</div></div><p>On Monday,  Swiatek broke first for a 3-1 lead in the opening set. The intensity, fast footwork and baseline aggression that were on display in her straightforward win over Sabalenka in the semifinals continued against Pegula.</p>\n<p>Swiatek took the first set in a swift 27 minutes, a daunting sign for Pegula, considering Swiatek\'s formidable 60-1 record when clinching the opening frame this season. She sustained her momentum, breaking Pegula in the first game of the second.</p>\n<p>"She played really solid," Pegula said. "I felt like she really was putting a lot of pressure on me. And I think I just was overplaying a lot today. I don\'t know why. But it just was one of those days where I felt like I was going for too much."</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrB_VVQuDAs?si=LQ1eytGjwtHdHc-r" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>With Pegula unable to find the consistent depth to bring Swiatek out of her comfort zone, she completed her ruthless display, and in the end, won 11 consecutive games and seal the championship in 59 minutes.</p>\n<p>"I\'m just really happy and super proud of myself," Swiatek said. "This week has been not easy, but I feel like it\'s a kind of a reflection of the whole season. So I\'m just happy that I could cope with everything well, and I kind of used my experience from all these years to perform well here."</p>\n<p>This past week, Swiatek tallied wins against three reigning major champions, posting straight-set victories over Australian Open champion Sabalenka, US Open champion Coco Gauff and Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova. She did not lose a single set in Cancun.</p>\n<p>Swiatek is the youngest WTA Finals champion since Petra Kvitova won in Istanbul in 2011. She is the second Polish champion at the event after Agnieszka Radwanska won in Singapore in 2015.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>',

They have won four titles this year, all in the past four months: Washington D.C., Ningbo, Nanchang (a title they had to win in order to qualify for the WTA Finals), and now this week in Cancun. They also reached this year\'s US Open final.</p>\n<p><em><strong>WTA Finals: <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/scores">Scores</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/draws">Draws</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/order-of-play">Order of play</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Fast facts:</strong> Siegemund, 35, and Zvonareva, 39, are two of the three oldest players to have qualified for Cancun in either doubles or singles this year (fellow 35-year-old Shuko Aoyama is slightly older than Siegemund).</p>\n<p>But experience proved to be a factor in their favor. The 2020 US Open champions Siegemund and Zvonareva notched three wins in the past two days en route to the year-end championships title, in their first qualification as a partnership.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Feeling the love in Cancun 🫶<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun</a> <a href="https://t.co/3GsHtyq6eQ">pic.twitter.com/3GsHtyq6eQ</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1721629226455933098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Zvonareva had previously qualified for the WTA Finals in doubles way back in 2007, as well as five times in singles (she was the 2008 WTA Finals singles runner-up, losing in the final to Venus Williams). This week marked Siegemund\'s WTA Finals debut.</p>\n<p>Zvonareva, who gave birth to daughter Evelina in 2016, is the first mother to win the doubles event at the WTA Finals since Cara Black in 2014.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>As for Siegemund, she is the first German to ever win the WTA Finals doubles title. Claudia Kohde-Kilsch made five doubles finals at the WTA Finals during the 1980s, once alongside fellow German Eva Pfaff, but none of those chances were converted into titles.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Melichar-Martinez and Perez ended an excellent week by reaching the final as the lowest-seeded team in the field. However, they finish 2023 with an 0-5 record in finals this year.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><p><strong>Match moments:</strong> In the first set, both teams were superb saving break points, so Siegemund and Zvonareva’s sole break of Perez for 2-1 proved to be decisive. Melichar-Martinez and Perez saved the other seven break points they faced in the set, but that was not enough as Siegemund and Zvonareva erased all five they stared down.</p>\n<p>"Everything was tight and close," Zvonareva said. "And then we got a few small opportunities to take a break. And I think we did great on those opportunities. Every single opportunity that we had, we took advantage of."</p>\n<p>In the second set, Siegemund cracked a backhand crosscourt winner to break Melichar-Martinez at love, again to lead 2-1. But on deciding point in the next game, Melichar-Martinez fired a winning volley, earning her team’s first break of the day and leveling the set at 2-2.</p>\n<p>In the very next game, though, back-to-back groundstroke winners by Zvonareva lined up another deciding point. Perez then ceded her serve with a double fault, putting Siegemund and Zvonareva up a break once more.</p>\n<p>At 5-4, Zvonareva saw the first two championship points on her serve swiped away, but brilliant volleying by Siegemund made sure the third time was the charm, completing the win after 1 hour and 38 minutes.</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cdcZ0AuK_c?si=rOXWJzDx7p3TU6Um" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

Here\'s a look back at Zvonareva\'s unexpected return to the top of the game and the duo\'s path to success.</em></p>\n<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Last March, Vera Zvonareva and Laura Siegemund won the doubles title at the Miami Open.</p>\n<p>And then Zvonareva, a 37-year-old mother contemplating a move to Dubai with her family -- and suffering from a chronically aching right shoulder -- told her partner she was done for the season.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, long after Siegemund had moved on and committed to playing with Kirsten Flipkens, Zvonareva asked, almost sheepishly, if she wanted to renew their partnership.</p>\n<p>What changed ahead of the GNP Seguro WTA Finals?</p>\n<p>Siegemund, sitting next to Zvonareva for the interview, interjected, “Yeah, that’s what I want to know.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>WTA Finals: <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/scores">Scores</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/draws">Draws</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/order-of-play">Order of play</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The answer, like the tale of Zvonareva’s long and winding career in professional tennis, is not a simple one. She never announced her retirement, but when she gave birth to daughter Evelina in 2016, then suffered through a number of aborted comebacks, Zvonareva was “90 percent” certain last year that she was done.</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert: Zvonareva, now 39 -- four years older than any other qualifier here in Cancun -- is ranked No.16 in doubles. That’s her highest ranking in 17 years. A few months ago, she and Siegemund, finalists at the recent US Open, weren’t even in the year-end conversation. Now they’re the No.6 seeds.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>In terms of tennis, Zvonareva has already lived through several generations. When she turned professional in 2000, fellow qualifiers Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff were not yet born. When Zvonareva made the Wimbledon and US Open singles finals in 2010, she was defeated, respectively, by Kim Clijsters and Serena Williams. The field at the WTA Finals in Doha that year included Zvonareva, Caroline Wozniacki, Jelena Jankovic, Elena Dementieva -- and a 21-year-old Victoria Azarenka.</p>\n<p>In an era when former No.1-ranked Ashleigh Barty can retire at 25, how is it possible that Zvonareva is still a viable, relevant player at the highest reaches of the game at 39?</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BIG win, BIG debut 👊<br /><br />Vera Zvonareva and <a href="https://twitter.com/laurasiegemund?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@laurasiegemund</a> lock in their spot at the GNP Seguros <a href="https://twitter.com/WTAFinals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WTAFinals</a> and will be making their debut!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> <a href="https://t.co/YjuXoMNPLN">pic.twitter.com/YjuXoMNPLN</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1716079384082223312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>“I love the sport,” she said. “And I always have this kind of perfectionism in me. When I start doing something, I want to do it the best way I can. Obviously, the way I look at tennis now, it’s very much different from when I looked at it when I was 20. I’m much more relaxed in many, many things.</p>\n<p>“If I lose the match, it doesn’t hurt me so much because I know I gave it all. And I think that’s what kind of helps me at my age to continue with my career because I enjoy the moment. And I think at the end of the day, you have some wins and that motivates you to come back and try again.”</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/3751374/road-to-the-wta-finals-siegemund-and-zvonareva">Road to the WTA Finals: Siegemund and Zvonareva</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The rest of the doubles field marvels at Zvonareva’s longevity.</p>\n<p>“Passion,” said Demi Schuurs.</p>\n<p>“Dedication,” echoed her partner, Desirae Krawczyk. “You love to compete, you love to be on tour. But it’s making sacrifices. She’s doing it for her daughter, she’s doing it for herself. It’s amazing, actually.”</p>\n<p><strong>An instant connection</strong></p>\n<p>Zvonareva finished that watershed season in 2010 as the No.2-ranked singles player in the world. She was a fixture at the WTA Finals, qualifying four times from 2004-11, reaching the final in 2008 before losing to Venus Williams.</p>\n<p>There was a robust doubles schedule early in her career, finishing in the Top 10 in 2006, but she gradually began to focus on singles. And then, injuries began to accumulate, most notably her right shoulder.</p>\n<p>She picked up her fourth major doubles title at the 2012 Australian Open but limped through the season and achieved her goal of appearing in the Olympics for Russia. Zvonareva underwent surgery in 2013 and was never again an effective singles player.</p>\n<p>Zvonareva got married in 2015 and gave birth to her daughter in 2016.</p>\n<p>“After that,” she said, “I was never planning on coming back.”</p>\n<p>But the draw of the game proved irresistible. She played a modest singles schedule in 2017 and over the next three years, mixing in some doubles as well.</p>\n<p>In 2020, Zvonareva played four tournaments with three different doubles partners -- before deciding to pair, for the first time, with Siegemund for the US Open.</p>\n<p>“I can remember that pretty well,” the 35-year-old Siegemund said. “We won.”</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>It was the first major title for Siegemund and the fifth for Zvonareva.</p>\n<p>Injuries, on both sides, and life in general prevented them from putting together a cohesive campaign. And when Zvonareva, suffering from a debilitating Achilles injury, stepped away after they took the Miami title last year, that appeared to be the end.</p>\n<p>At this point in the narrative, Zvonareva and Siegemund started to sound like an old married couple, interrupting and finishing each other’s sentences. Siegemund, who was curious and genuinely didn’t know critical parts of Zvonareva’s narrative, took over the reporter’s role and launched a spirited Q&amp;A.</p>\n<p>Siegemund, who wanted a permanent partner, began 2023 with Flipkens. But at home in Dubai, Zvonareva was invited to a January pro-am exhibition. Thinking nothing of it, she accepted.</p>\n<p>“I was living there and he asked me -- how can you blame me for saying yes?” Zvonareva said. “I thought, `Wow, I just have to see.’”</p>\n<p>“And then,” Siegemund said, “you crushed it. And you were like, `Hey, remember me?’”</p>\n<p>Their first 2023 tournament was Miami, where they were defending champions. They lost their second match. But then they reached the semifinals in Charleston and won a WTA 125 in Paris before it all began to gel. They advanced to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, won the title in Washington, D.C. and made the finals at the US Open.</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFWqvnJHHnU?si=ylBrV07B7-RUoSvH" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>And now, they’re in Cancun. For Zvonareva, it’s a back-to-the-future moment; her first (and only) doubles appearance at year-end came in 2005 with Elena Likhovtseva.</p>\n<p>“Wow,” said Katerina Siniakova, who teamed with Barbora Krejcikova to win this year’s Australian Open. “It’s amazing that she feels healthy and she’s playing so well.”</p>\n<p>Could she see herself playing at 39?</p>\n<p>“No,” Siniakova answered.</p>\n<p>Siegemund always knew she and Zvonareva played well together -- on the occasions they were able to play.</p>\n<p>“When we were able, yes, we did decent at a minimum,” Siegemund said. “And I knew that if we could have a whole year, for me, the finals would always be your goal with that.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy we finally got here.”</p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Chris Evert was flipping through the match notes of the GNP Seguros WTA Finals, oohing and aahing at the records of the talented finalists.</p>\n<p>“When I look at how they have played, anything could happen,” Evert said.</p>\n<p>On Monday (4:30 p.m. local), the year-end No.1 ranking will come down to the Hologic WTA Tour’s last match of the 2023 season. If No.2 Iga Swiatek prevails against No.5 Jessica Pegula in the championship, she will regain the top spot she held for 75 weeks. If Pegula wins, Aryna Sabalenka will be the year-end No.1 for the first time.</p>\n<p>This is only the fifth time this century the No.1 ranking could change hands at the WTA Finals. The last time was 2009, when Serena Williams overtook Dinara Safina.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>Swiatek kept her hopes alive Sunday night with a resounding 6-3, 6-2 victory over Sabalenka. Pegula took out doubles partner Coco Gauff 6-2, 6-1 in the first semifinal Saturday night to advance to the biggest final of her career.</p>\n<p>Pegula, after losing all three of her matches at last year’s WTA Finals in Fort Worth, is now a flawless 4-0 in Estadio Paradisus. She has beaten No.1-ranked Sabalenka, No.3 Gauff, No.4 Elena Rybakina and No.9 Maria Sakkari -- and now contemplates No.2 Swiatek.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, with Iga, I think having two wins over her this year is going to give me a lot of confidence,” Pegula told reporters. “But I think she’s someone where when she’s hot, she can kind of steamroll everybody. And I feel like that’s what she’s doing right now.”</p>\n<p>The head-to-head record favors Swiatek, 5-3, but Pegula won the last time they played, in a three-set semifinal in Montreal this summer.</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHYRgJfH9O4?si=Qdkbr0mVFLf8H1k-" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>Swiatek called Pegula a complete player.</p>\n<p>“She’s just solid, really good at everything,” Swiatek said. “Also, I think she’s mature and uses that. But I know what I can do. I’ll be ready.”</p>\n<p>We asked 18-time Grand Slam singles champions Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, WTA Finals ambassadors here in Cancun, who their picks were in Monday’s final.</p>\n<p>Navratilova and Evert faced off a record 80 times in their career. Let’s make it 81:</p>\n<h2><strong>The case for Swiatek</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Evert: “</strong>The last couple of weeks, she’s done really well, winning the title in Beijing and now getting to this final. Iga had a disappointing Wimbledon and a disappointing US Open. She wants to finish the year strong. And I think she’s got enough left over to pull it off. I know that some people have been disappointed with her 2023 season because the only major she won was Roland Garros, but look at the overall picture: She’s 22 years old. If she wins this, and finishes the year-end back at No.1, is she the Player of the Year? I think so.”</p>\n<p><em>Notable stat: Swiatek has more wins (67) and titles (5) than any player on tour this year. Her 67 wins equal her total from last year.</em></p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"I\'m happy that I could really show you guys my game."<a href="https://twitter.com/iga_swiatek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@iga_swiatek</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GNPSegurosWTAFinalsCancun</a> <a href="https://t.co/mZrWIxz1AI">pic.twitter.com/mZrWIxz1AI</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1721323247885586905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Navratilova: “</strong>With No.1 on the line after beating Sabalenka, absolutely it’s motivation for Iga to win this last match. But … it’s also a lot of pressure. I don’t know the last time the last match of the year came to the No.1 ranking. Playing against Sabalenka, it was in her hands to deny her the No.1. That’s great, because you always want to be in control of your fate. And now in the final, Iga has control again. Think about it: You win the tournament, you get the trophy, you’re No.1 -- it doesn’t get any better than that.”</p>\n<p><em>Notable stat: If she returns to No.1, she will become the sixth-youngest youngest player to finish as year-end No.1 in back-to-back seasons.</em></p>\n<h2><strong>The case for Pegula</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Evert: “</strong>Woo! She lost all her matches a year ago in Fort Worth -- 0-6 singles and doubles combined -- and look at what she’s done here, solid as a rock. On Saturday she had a chance to reach <em>both</em> finals. Her game is well suited to these conditions. The only thing I wonder is how tired she is. She’s played more than 120 matches this year in singles and doubles. At this point, I think it’s more of a mental thing. Can she win this? In a word, yes.”</p>\n<p><em>Notable stat: Facing down the World No.1, No.3, and No.4, Pegula has lost just 22 games en route to the final. When she faces No.2 Swiatek on Monday, she will become the first player to face the World No.1, No.2, No.3 and No.4 in a single event since the WTA Rankings were published in 1975.  </em></p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1 - Jessica Pegula will be the first player to face the World No. 1, No. 2, No.3 and No. 4 in a single event since the WTA Rankings were published in 1975.

The way she played against Gauff, it didn’t even seem like it was windy on her side of the court. Jessica’s game is perfect for these conditions.<strong> </strong>If she can keep it up, I think she can definitely win. It’s just a clean game, with the wind or against the wind. She reminds me of Lindsay Davenport, the way she’s hitting it. She doesn’t seem to hit it that hard, but it carries -- it’s a heavy ball and it gets through the wind. She said in an interview that she just made the decision to not let anything bother her, and it shows.”</p>\n<p><em>Notable stat: Pegula is going for her 10th win over a Top 10 opponent this season. Since 2000, only four Americans have tallied 10 Top 10 wins in a calendar year: Venus Williams, Jennifer Capriati, Lindsay Davenport and Serena Williams.</em></p>\n<h2>And the winner will be ...</h2>\n<p><strong>Navratilova: Pegula</strong></p>\n<p>"She has yet to drop a match and is playing with a high level of confidence. She has been unnerved by the conditions here, and that mindset will help her upset Iga in a close match." </p>\n<p><em>Notable stat: Pegula is 51-0 this season when she wins the first set. Along with Rybakina, she is one of just two players to have beaten Swiatek twice this season.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Evert: Swiatek</strong></p>\n<p>"The No.1 ranking hangs in the balance, and Iga does not want anything less. She came here to reclaim it, and she won\'t stop in the final."</p>\n<p><em>Notable stat: Swiatek is 16-4 in finals. In their only meeting in a tournament final, Swiatek defeated Pegula 6-3, 6-0 in Doha this year. </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- No.2 Iga Swiatek will face No.5 Jessica Pegula for the title at the GNP Seguros WTA Finals Cancun. </p>\n<p>Monday\'s bout will decide the fate of the year-end No.1 ranking. If Swiatek wins her tour-leading sixth title of the season, she will overtake No.1 Aryna Sabalenka to finish in the top spot for the second consecutive season. </p>\n<p>Here\'s what you need to know about the high-stakes showdown in Cancun.</p>\n<h3>When is the women\'s final?</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The finals will both be played on Monday, Nov. 6. The doubles final, which features No.6 Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva against No.8 Nicole Melichar-Martinez and Ellen Perez, will be played at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>The singles final will follow at 4:30 p.m.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><h3>What are the points and prize money at stake?</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Points and prize money at the WTA Finals are distributed based on participation and wins. By virtue of going 3-0 in round-robin play, Swiatek and Pegula have each already earned $1,602,000 by making the final. They have also earned 1,080 points. </p>\n<p>The WTA Finals champion will add an additional $1,476,000 in prize money and 420 ranking points. </p>\n<p>If Swiatek wins, she will finish the year at World No.1. </p>\n<h3>How did Swiatek and Pegula get here?</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Swiatek capped off her regular season with a title run in Beijing, her fifth title of the season. Drawn into the Chetumal Group in Cancun, Swiatek did not lose a set in round-robin play. She defeated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-6(3), 6-0, US Open champion Coco Gauff 6-0, 7-5 and No.6 seed Ons Jabeur 6-1, 6-2. She lost just 14 games. Since the round-robin format was reinstated in 2003, a player has lost fewer than 14 games in group play only twice: Justine Henin and ... Swiatek last year. </p>\n<p>Into the semifinals, Swiatek kept her bid for the No.1 ranking alive by defeating Sabalenka 6-3, 6-2 in a match that lasted over two days because of rain delays. The victory extended her current win streak to 10. </p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n\n\n</div><p>Pegula is also streaking. After finishing off her regular season with a title run in Seoul for her second title of the year, Pegula extended her winning streak to nine consecutive matches with her unbeaten run in Cancun. Drawn into the tough Bacalar Group that included Sabalenka and No.4 Rybakina, Pegula did not lose a set.</p>\n<p>Pegula\'s 6-4, 6-3 win over Sabalenka was her third victory over a reigning No.1 this year, having beaten Swiatek twice on hard courts this year. Along with her wins over No.3 Gauff and No.4 Rybakina, Pegula is now 6-1 against Top 5 opponents this season. A champion in Guadalajara last year, she is now 9-0 in Mexico. </p>\n<h3>How do they stack up?</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Swiatek leads the head-to-head series 5-3, but Pegula is one of just two players to defeat Swiatek twice this year. Pegula bested her at the United Cup, winning 6-2, 6-2 in the semifinals, and Swiatek avenged the loss a month later during her title run in Doha, where she won 6-3, 6-0 in the final. </p>\n<p>Most recently, Pegula and Swiatek faced off in the semifinals in Montreal, where the American edged out a 6-2, 6-7(4), 6-4. </p>\n<p>In Cancun, both women have been in dominant form. Both went undefeated and neither has lost a set. Swiatek has lost 19 games, matching the fewest games dropped en route to the final (Justine Henin, 2007). Pegula has lost 22.</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hs5TMsCNhhE?si=fwWpXFplFjz25-Vt" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<h3>What\'s at stake?</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both players are bidding to win the season-ending championships for the first time. </p>\n<p>In addition to the No.1 ranking, Swiatek is bidding for her sixth title of the season and 17th career title. A win would extend her current win streak to 11 matches. She would become the second Polish player to lift the season-ending trophy, joining Agnieszka Radwanska in 2015. </p>\n<p>A champion in Warsaw (WTA 250), Doha and Stuttgart (WTA 500), Beijing (WTA 1000) and Roland Garros (Grand Slam), a win at the WTA Finals would give Swiatek a title at every Hologic WTA Tour level this season. The last player to accomplish this feat was Serena Williams in 2014.</p>\n<p>If she returns to No.1, Swiatek would become the sixth-youngest player to finish at No.1 in back-to-back seasons. Only Chris Evert in 1976, Steffi Graf in 1988 and 1989, Monica Seles in 1992, Martina Hingis in 2000 and Caroline Wozniacki in 2011 were younger.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">19 - Since the current Round Robin format was introduced in 2003, Iga Swiatek is now the player with the fewest games dropped to reach the final (19, level with Justine Henin in 2007).

But again, I think she\'s someone where when she\'s hot, she can kind of steamroll everybody, and I feel like that\'s what she\'s doing right now. She\'s also I think, probably the best player in the wind in these conditions, because her footwork is so good. And coming off the Beijing win, I think she has a lot of confidence as well."</p>\n<p><strong>Swiatek: </strong>"I feel like [the No.1] is still a long way because tomorrow\'s match should be like the toughest one. It\'s not going to be easy against Jessie. She really showed that she can play in any conditions. So, still a long way. For now, I\'m just like really focused on just continuing what I have been doing for the past days, and I managed to do this tonight, even though this match was also with a lot of hype and everything. So I\'m pretty sure tomorrow is going to be similar for me in terms of my mentality."</p>\n<p><strong>Pegula:</strong> "I had such a successful year last year, it was hard to imagine making it that much more successful. And I\'ve managed to really get my act together at the end of the year, have a great week in Seoul, do well in Asia and then I think I did a good job of carrying that momentum here. I think I improved that a lot compared to last year, where it was a new experience for me, and I wasn\'t sure what I was doing or how I was playing. And it\'s not fun to leave 0-6. So I\'m glad I\'m definitely turning the tables this year." </p>\n<p><strong>Swiatek:</strong> "It\'s not like the biggest final, but it\'s one of the biggest finals that I played. So for sure, exciting and a little bit different challenge, because I\'ve never been in the final of WTA Finals. So you know, last match of the season and all that stuff. All the fuss around the tournament makes it special.</p>\n<p>"But overall, I feel like me and Jessie, we played really in a smart way and we really kept calm. We\'re pretty focused and just taking the most we can from these matches and conditions. So I truly think that we both deserve to be in a final."</p>\n<p> </p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Iga Swiatek defeated World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 6-2 on Sunday at the GNP Seguro WTA Finals.</p>\n<p>If Swiatek wins Monday’s championship match against Jessica Pegula, she’ll regain the top spot she relinquished two months ago and finish as the year-end No.1 for the second straight time. If Pegula prevails, Sabalenka will finish on top for the first time in her career.</p>\n<p>It’s only the fifth time this century that the No.1 ranking was in play at the WTA Finals, the last occurring in 2009, when Serena Williams caught Dinara Safina at the finish line.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>With the No.1 ranking on the line, is it something Swiatek is thinking about heading into the match with Pegula? </p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s still a long way away because I feel like tomorrow’s match will be the toughest one,” Swiatek said. “We can talk about it tomorrow after the match. I’m just going to continue doing what I’ve been doing in [recent] days.</p>\n<p>“I can’t truly tell you the keys for tomorrow. I’m going to work on that tonight.”</p>\n<p>Swiatek is now 6-3 in career matches against Sabalenka -- and has won all four of her matches in Estadio Paradisus, all against Top 10 players. Going back to her recent title in Beijing, Swiatek has won 10 consecutive matches.</p>\n<p>The 22-year-old from Poland has dropped a total of only 19 games in Cancun, the fewest by any player to reach the WTA Finals championship match since Justine Henin in 2007. Swiatek is also the youngest player to reach the WTA Finals championship match since Petra Kvitova and Victoria Azarenka in 2011.</p>\n<p><em><strong>WTA Finals: <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/scores">Scores</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/draws">Draws</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/order-of-play">Order of play</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Pegula, meanwhile, is also 4-0, winning all her Top 10 matches in straight sets. She’s the first to face the Nos.1, 2, 3 and 4-ranked players in the same tournament since the WTA Tour rankings came into being in 1975 -- and, of course, could be the first to defeat them all.</p>\n<p>Swiatek has now won a total of 67 matches this year, equaling her marvelous 2022 campaign.</p><div class="articleWidget center"><div class="embeddable-widget">\n    <div data-fek-settings=\'{"primaryColour":"#000000"}\'></div>\n    <div data-fek-poll="3ba7bf97-e19c-42a6-81c6-1fa4dc2ffa31" id="fek-3ba7bf97-e19c-42a6-81c6-1fa4dc2ffa31"></div><script async src="https://sdk.fek.pulselive.com/fek-sdk-client-web/latest/client.min.js"></script>\n</div></div><p>The match resumed on Sunday, with 18 minutes elapsed and Sabalenka serving to level the first set at 2-all, 30-all. Swiatek needed only two points to break her serve, setting a tone for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>Swiatek served out the set, hitting a sharp backhand down the line that Sabalenka couldn’t quite track down, sending a running forehand long. While the wind wasn’t as substantial as it had been all week long, it was a factor. There were a number of times when Sabalenka was swinging off-balance along the baseline. Swiatek, with flawless footwork, rarely looked out of sync.</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHYRgJfH9O4?si=V5vBbFZPtIh44xBU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>The third game of the second set was a test of wills, won by Swiatek. She converted her fourth break point with another error from Sabalenka. Later, in the seventh game, Swiatek broke Sabalenka for the third time in the match before serving out the win.</p>\n<p>The final statistics underlined the narrow margins at play in this match. Sabalenka finished with only five winners -- and 18 unforced errors. Swiatek clocked in with nine and nine, typical of her consistent game.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>',

I’m feeling confident going into the finals.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>WTA Finals: <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/scores">Scores</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/draws">Draws</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/order-of-play">Order of play</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Pegula, after losing all three of her matches at last year’s WTA Finals in Fort Worth, is now a pristine 4-0 in Estadio Paradisus. For the record, she has beaten No.1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, No.3 Gauff, No.4 Elena Rybakina and No.9 Maria Sakkari.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><p>Is the undefeated Pegula the favorite?</p>\n<p>“No,” she said, “I don’t think I consider myself the favorite, considering the two girls [Sabalenka and Swiatek] are ranked ahead of me. I’ll probably be considered the underdog, even though I’m playing great tennis."</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>Gauff, also 0-3 in Fort Worth, finished here 2-2. She has now lost three of four career matches to Pegula.</p>\n<p>“She was playing well with the wind -- and I wasn’t,” Gauff told reporters. “I mean we both had the same circumstances. She just handled them better than I did.”</p>\n<p>At 29, Pegula is a decade older than Gauff -- and her experience showed in extremely windy conditions. During a rain break in the second set, the umbrella being held over Gauff’s changeover chair was blown inside out. She was often tentative and seemed conflicted about whether to maintain a safe margin with her shots -- or go for winners.</p><div class="articleWidget center"><div class="embeddable-widget">\n    <div data-fek-settings=\'{"primaryColour":"#000000"}\'></div>\n    <div data-fek-poll="f9964ca2-0a1c-4fe7-87b9-9fa6d2c9bf9d" id="fek-f9964ca2-0a1c-4fe7-87b9-9fa6d2c9bf9d"></div><script async src="https://sdk.fek.pulselive.com/fek-sdk-client-web/latest/client.min.js"></script>\n</div></div><p>The two players each broke each other early, but with the score 2-all, Pegula went to work. She broke Gauff for the second time when a netcord ball fell back. Pegula held and broke a second straight time when a Gauff forehand service return soared long.</p>\n<p>Pegula broke Gauff for the fourth time to open the second set and again in the fifth game. Rain interrupted play again with Pegula leading 4-1 and she finished with a flourish, breaking Gauff one more time.</p>\n<p>“It’s probably my biggest final ever,” Pegula said. “It’s going to give me a lot of confidence going into next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Notable stats: </strong>Gauff was broken six times and lost 29 of her 49 service points. She finished with only six winners and 25 unforced errors. Pegula was a tidier nine and 11.</p>\n<p>Gauff was bidding to become the first teenager to reach the final at WTA Finals since Martina Hingis did it in 1999. The last teenager to win the title at the WTA finals was Maria Sharapova in 2004.</p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hs5TMsCNhhE?si=25JZOhBSSPqOpSRM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>Pegula is the first player since Elina Svitolina in 2019 to reach the last match of the WTA Finals after winning her first four matches.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s next:</strong> In addition to Sunday’s final, Pegula will have to navigate her way through a complicated doubles situation. Initially, she and Gauff were scheduled to play three potential matches. Their round-robin match against Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva was suspended Friday, with the Americans leading 6-3, 1-1 -- with the last spot in the semifinals hanging in the balance.</p>\n<p>With the two singles matches the priority, doubles was deferred. If Gauff and Pegula, the top seeds, win that suspended match in straight sets -- or in three, so long as they win three games in the second set -- they would be in line to play the team of Storm Hunter and Elise Mertens in the semifinals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- With only two days left in the Hologic WTA Tour’s 2023 season, the year-end No.1 ranking is still in play.</p>\n<p>In a delightful turn of events for the global tennis community, the two players involved will face each other in a Saturday semifinal at the GNP Seguros WTA Finals Cancun.</p>\n<p>In an ocean of scenarios, this one is pretty simple:</p>\n<p>If No.1 Aryna Sabalenka defeats No.2 Iga Swiatek, she’ll retain the top spot she assumed after the US Open.</p>\n<p>If Swiatek wins, she must then win the championship Sunday to regain the No.1 ranking she held for 75 consecutive weeks.</p>\n<p>Here\'s Saturday\'s semifinal schedule, which includes one doubles round-robin match that will determine the fourth semifinalists:</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>Sabalenka said at the US Open she didn’t want Swiatek to lose the fourth-round match to Jelena Ostapenko that triggered the succession.</p>\n<p><em><strong>WTA Finals: <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/scores">Scores</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/draws">Draws</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/order-of-play">Order of play</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>“I really wanted to play against her to decide who’s the No.1 in the world,” Sabalenka told reporters before the semifinals were set. “So I said that and I have the opportunity to make it happen -- it’s a possibility that we’re going to play for the No.1 spot.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><p>“So I would love to play against Iga. That would be a really incredible match.”</p>\n<p>Martina Navratilova, an 18-time major champion, is here in Cancun as an ambassador. Fourteen of those Grand Slam titles came in the seven years she finished as the No.1 player.</p>\n<p>“For me, a massive thing is who is No.1 at the end of the year,” Navratilova said, "And then who wins this. It\'s the biggest tournament of our tour. So any time you can put that into your trophy case, you’re doing pretty well. And now you get a trophy for being No.1 at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>With her insight, let’s break down the matches:</p>\n<h2><strong>No.1 Aryna Sabalenka vs. No.2 Iga Swiatek</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>The case for Sabalenka: </strong>While she has consistently downplayed the burden of defending the No.1 ranking here, clearly Sabalenka is aware of the situation.</p>\n<p>She nearly came unstrung on several occasions during a two-day struggle with Elena Rybakina that was marred by numerous rain relays but managed to compose herself and win in three sets. That vaulted her into the final four and left the No.1 ranking within her control.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">4 - The World No. 1 (Sabalenka) and World No. 2 (Swiatek) will face each other at the WTA Finals SFs for the 4th time in the last 40 years after Wozniacki-Zvonareva (2010), Azarenka-Sharapova (2012) and Barty-Pliskova (2019).

The 22-year-old from Poland has a career head-to-head advantage of 5-3. This year, though, they’ve split matches with Swiatek winning the Stuttgart final in straight sets and Sabalenka taking the Madrid final in three.</p>\n<p>How good has Sabalenka’s season been? She’s the first woman in 17 years (Justine Henin) to reach at least the semifinals of all four majors and the WTA Finals.</p>\n<p><strong>Navratilova’s take: “</strong>If you think about it, it’s unbelievable -- a perfect ending, except for the fact it’s the semifinals, instead of the finals. Bottom line, who can handle the pressure better with so much riding on it? Aryna was an Amazon for two days, so I think it’s 50-50.”</p>\n<p><strong>The case for Swiatek: </strong>The World No.2 actually qualified before she even took the court for her third round-robin match, thanks to Marketa Vondrousova’s first-set win over Coco Gauff.</p>\n<p>But to guarantee she would have a say in the No.1 conversation, Swiatek needed to win one set against Ons Jabeur. This she did, taking six of the first seven games in a gusty affair at the end of Friday night. Swiatek closed the match by dropping only three games in total. She lost just 14 in the group stage. Only Justine Henin (11) and Swiatek herself last year (13) have lost fewer games since the current format was introduced in 2003. In fact, she\'s the only player to lose fewer than 20 games twice.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In full flight ✈️<a href="https://twitter.com/iga_swiatek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@iga_swiatek</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> <a href="https://t.co/A0VK2gPfpQ">pic.twitter.com/A0VK2gPfpQ</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1720640521817706947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Swiatek is the first player to score at least 10 wins against Top 10 players for consecutive seasons since Serena Williams in 2013-14. She is currently riding a nine-match win streak.</p>\n<p><strong>Navratilova’s take: “</strong>When Sabalenka’s ball comes in fast, the wind makes it easier to handle. Overall, the wind favors Swiatek. With her spin, she’s able to navigate those gusts -- there’s much less that can go wrong with her game.”</p>\n<h2><strong>No. 5 Jessica Pegula vs. No.3 Coco Gauff</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>The case for Pegula: </strong>A year ago in Fort Worth, she went 0-3 in singles. This year, the 29-year-old American defeated No.1 Sabalenka, No.4 Rybakina and No.9 Maria Sakkari to win the Bacalar Group -- how’s that for flipping the script?</p>\n<p>“I’ve gained confidence playing against the top players and getting wins,” Pegula told reporters. “Now, obviously, I don’t want to be too confident, but I don’t really think I have that problem.”</p><div class="articleWidget

Gauff came back to defeat Vondrousova 5-7, 7-6 (4), 6-3 before Swiatek closed out the proceedings with Jabeur.</p>\n<p>Since losing in the opening round at Wimbledon, Gauff has won an astounding 24 of her past 27 matches, with two of those defeats coming to Swiatek and one to Pegula.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n\n\n</div><p>Gauff, still only 19, has already achieved all kinds of history here. She’s the first teenager to reach the semifinals of the WTA Finals since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009. Gauff can become only the third teenager to reach the final, since 2002 --after Kim Clijsters (2002) and Maria Sharapova (2004).</p>\n<p>“Playing Jess, she’s been playing great in these conditions,” Gauff said. “I’ve been watching her matches, and we obviously know each other’s games very well. So it\'s going to be a tough matchup. I think she’s so far playing the best out of all the eight girls.”</p>\n<p><strong>Navratilova’s take: “</strong>In my opinion, Coco has to serve better. She had, what, 17 double faults against Vondrousova? Even with the bloody wind, that won’t cut it. She showed some great mental strength in coming back to beat Vondrousova. Coco has that extra ingredient that most people don’t have.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- No.2 Iga Swiatek and No.3 Coco Gauff secured their spots in the semifinals of the GNP Seguros WTA Finals Cancun on a wind-strewn Friday evening.</p>\n<p>Gauff won a battle of two of the Grand Slam champions from this season at the GNP Seguros WTA Finals, defeating Marketa Vondrousova 5-7, 6-7(4), 6-3 in the final round of group play on Friday night.</p>\n<p>The win eliminated the Wimbledon champion\'s hopes of advancing to the semifinals. Gauff is the first teenager to make the final four of the year-end championships since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, Swiatek confirmed her position as the group winner after defeating No.6 seed Ons Jabeur 6-1, 6-2 to go 3-0 in the Chetumal Group.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WtSLDWmxxA?si=STXSAhFrCuSJVrBW" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>On Saturday, Swiatek will face No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in a match that could decide the year-end No.1 ranking. If Sabalenka wins, she will finish the year at No.1. If Swiatek prevails, she can retake the top spot only by winning the title. This is a rematch of last year\'s semifinal in Fort Worth, where Sabalenka won 6-2, 2-6, 6-1. The two have split their two meetings this season, both on clay. Swiatek won the Stuttgart final, while Sabalenka took Madrid.</p>\n<p>"We\'ll see what the conditions are going to be," Swiatek said. "Against Aryna it\'s never easy. I\'m just gonna do my best and focus on myself and what I want to do on court. We usually have these matches that are really exciting and really tough, both mentally and physically."</p>\n<p>The other semifinal will showcase Gauff against No.5 Jessica Pegula. It will be the first all-American semifinal at the WTA Finals since the reintroduction of the round-robin format in 2003. Both players are making their semifinal debuts at the year-end tournament. Last year in Fort Worth the duo went winless in both singles and doubles. This will be the third meeting of the year between the two top-ranked Americans. Gauff won on the grass in Eastbourne and Pegula got her revenge during her title run in Montreal this summer.</p>\n<p>Saturday\'s semifinal schedule, which includes one remaining round-robin doubles match that will determine the fourth semifinalists:</p>\n<p><strong>2:30 p.m.</strong><br />[7] Gabriela Dabrowski &amp; Erin Routliffe vs. [8] Nicole Melichar-Martinez &amp; Ellen Perez<br /><strong>NB 5:00 p.m.</strong> <br />[5] Jessica Pegula vs. [3] Coco Gauff <br /><strong>NB 6:00 p.m.</strong><br />[1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. [2] Iga Swiatek<br />[1] Coco Gauff &amp; Jessica Pegula vs. [6] Laura Siegemund &amp; Vera Zvonareva (to finish, 6-3, 1-1)<br /><br /><strong>After suitable rest  </strong><br />TBC vs. [2] Storm Hunter &amp; EliseMertens </p>\n<div id="" class="youtubeThumb center" title="Embedded YouTube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MISF9xNNgy0?si=gIUu6fAYryGiBE0j" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<p>In a match with multiple interruptions because of intermittent rain, Gauff improved her record over Vondrousova to 3-0. As the players adjusted to the conditions, Vondrousova led by a double-break at 3-0 in the first set and held off the American\'s comeback attempt to take it 7-5.</p>\n<p>Gauff looked on her way to quickly taking Vondrousova into a deciding set after dominating the first five games of the second to lead 4-1. But after failing to serve out the set at 5-3, Gauff found herself four points from defeat. With Vondrousova serving for the win at 6-5, the American threw caution to the wind, playing aggressive tennis to overpower Vondrousova and take the match to a third set.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Getting the crowd HYPED 🗣<br /><br />Vondrousova serves for the match, but <a href="https://twitter.com/CocoGauff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocoGauff</a> levels the score at 5-7, 7-6(4).<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> <a href="https://t.co/kQ2CaYDQk9">pic.twitter.com/kQ2CaYDQk9</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1720604794228711882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>"I felt like I needed to hit through the court," Gauff said. "She\'s a very tricky player. When you play her pace and let her move you side to side it\'s tough. And I played her, it\'s my third time, so I know that.</p>\n<p>"But obviously, in the wind, it\'s tough to be as aggressive as you want, because the bounces are weird and the ball was moving. So I\'m glad I made that adjustment and didn\'t get too frustrated when I missed. You pay the price for hopefully a good reward."</p>\n<p>Gauff\'s aggressive game plan, combining opportunistic forays into the net and flatter hitting from the baseline, continued in the final set. After breaking at love for a 3-2 lead, Gauff kept Vondrousova at bay to finish with a 2-1 record in the Chetumal group.</p>\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The victory is Gauff\'s 51st of the season. She is the first American teenager to register 50 or more wins in a single season since Venus Williams in 1999. She has won 24 of her last 27 matches, with those three losses coming to fellow semifinalists Swiatek (2) and Pegula. </span></p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',

    body: '<p>Back in her day -- the roaring, soaring ’80s -- Martina Navratilova wanted to win three tournaments more than all the others: Wimbledon, the US Open and the WTA Tour Finals.</p>\n<p>For the Americans, at least, the Australian Open and the French Open weren’t nearly as significant as they are today.</p>\n<p>“It was the year-end thing and everybody played -- it was our event,” Navratilova said recently. “For those supporting the tour it meant a lot, in many different ways.</p>\n<p>“The prize money was massive -- much bigger than the majors -- for many years, until the late ’80s it started catching up. And, it was one week of work instead of two. How great is that?”</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>No one was greater at the WTA Finals, then the Virginia Slims Championships, than Navratilova. She won eight singles titles, three more than those next in line, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf. And then there were 13 doubles championships -- maybe that’s why the year-end doubles trophy bears her name.</p>\n<p>Where does she place those titles on a spectacular career resume that includes 18 Grand Slam singles titles and 31 more in doubles?</p>\n<p>“High,” Navratilova said.</p>\n<p>"At least it should be up there with the majors, same level if you totaled it up that way.”</p>\n<p>Pam Shriver, who was Navratilova’s partner for the last 10 of those doubles titles (in an astonishing span of 11 years), goes even further.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>“It’s one of the great single-event records in tennis,” she said from her home in California. “Obviously, [Rafael] Nadal’s 14 at Roland Garros are the king. But her numbers -- eight singles and 13 doubles titles at the Finals -- are right up there. It’s another one of those records that will never be broken or even approached. It’s crazy, really.”</p>\n<p>For an athlete born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Navratilova was, for a number of reasons, a perfect fit for raucous, rollicking Madison Square Garden. After winning her first WTA Finals singles title in Oakland, California, she won the last seven in New York City.</p>\n<p>“The surface was perfect for my game,” Navratilova said. “Playing on the carpet, the ball bounced lower than on a hard court, more like the grass at Wimbledon. I didn’t like those high bounces.”</p>\n<p>And, she fed off the energy of the knowledgeable and excitable fans.</p>\n<p>“The crowd,” she said, “was pretty great. If it wasn’t sold out, it was close to it. We’d have 15,000 to 20,000 people there, and they made it easy to raise your game.”</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the Garden’s crisp lighting enabled her attacking style.</p>\n<p>“It was better than most indoor venues,” Navratilova said. “I could see the ball -- which for me, coming to the net, was essential.”</p>\n<p>Shriver was also a formidable singles player, reaching the 1988 final, losing to Gabriela Sabatini.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>“Yeah, but not everybody beats Evert and Graf and still doesn’t win the tournament,” Shriver said. “You just couldn’t beat the atmosphere at the Garden. The arena and the city really did elevate it to a big-time event.</p>\n<p>Navratilova defeated seven different players in those eight winning finals, doubling up Evert in 1983 and then in 1984, the year the WTA went to a best-of-five-set championship. Navratilova prevailed in that one, 6-3, 7-5, 6-1.</p>\n<p>The best-of-five final, in place from 1984-98, was a format that played to Navratilova’s strengths.</p>\n<p>“That was fun,” she said. “I wish we had 3-out-of-5 in the majors because it takes a lot of stress off and puts fitness more into play.”</p>\n<p>Another record that won’t be broken: In 1986, when the WTA Tour was in the process of shifting the year-end tournament to the fall, Navratilova won two championship finals, in March and November.</p>\n<p>She would reach a staggering 14 singles finals, losing, in order, to Evert, Tracy Austin, Sylvia Hanika, Graf and Monica Seles, twice. In doubles, it was a vastly different story. Navratilova advanced to 13 finals -- and won them all. The first came in 1977 with Betty Stove at the age of 20. Next came two with Billie Jean King, in 1978 and 1980, before the glorious run with Shriver.</p>\n<p>For some sobering context, consider that after Navratilova’s 13 doubles titles and Shriver’s 10, two players -- King and Lisa Raymond -- join them on the podium, with four doubles titles each.</p>\n<p>“I loved doubles,” Navratilova said. “I was always a better doubles player than a singles player. I had great partners.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>',

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the semifinals of the GNP Seguros WTA Finals with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 winner against Elena Rybakina on Friday,</p>\n<p>Sabalenka is now one step closer to finishing as the year-end No.1. If she wins her Saturday semifinal match, she’ll lock it down. If Sabalenka loses Saturday and Iga Swiatek goes on to win the title here, Swiatek will regain the top ranking she carried for 75 weeks but lost after the US Open.</p>\n<p><em><strong>WTA Finals: <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/scores">Scores</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/draws">Draws</a> | <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/tournament/808/wta-finals/2023/order-of-play">Order of play</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Sabalenka joined Jessica Pegula as the first two semifinalists this year.</p>\n<p>“Was really tough battle in really tough conditions,” Sabalenka said of the two-day match that ran 2 hours, 27 minutes. “I’m super happy that I was able to get this win no matter what.”</p>\n<p>This match began Thursday night but was plagued by several rain delays; play was suspended just past 11:30 p.m. with Sabalenka leading 6-2, 3-5. The two returned to the Estadio Paradisus court some 16 hours later.</p>\n<p>Inside two minutes, Rybakina had leveled the match at a set apiece.</p><div class="articleWidget center"><div class="embeddable-widget">\n    <div data-fek-settings=\'{"primaryColour":"#000000"}\'></div>\n    <div data-fek-poll="0d74c5b5-9194-4225-9da9-aff4c843b942" id="fek-0d74c5b5-9194-4225-9da9-aff4c843b942"></div><script async src="https://sdk.fek.pulselive.com/fek-sdk-client-web/latest/client.min.js"></script>\n</div></div><p>The first game of the third was a monumental test of wills, with Sabalenka surviving nine deuces and two break points in a 17-minute hold of serve. With Rybakina serving at 1-2, Sabalenka unleashed a pair of forehand winners to take the early lead.</p>\n<p>It was back on serve when Rybakina broke back, the deal-breaker being a Sabalenka double fault. Sabalenka then secured the third straight break of the set, at love, to take a decisive 4-2 lead.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">See you in the semis 👋<a href="https://twitter.com/SabalenkaA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SabalenkaA</a> defeats Rybakina 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 &amp; advances out of the Bacalar Group!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTAFinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTAFinals</a> <a href="https://t.co/kx1M022hhi">pic.twitter.com/kx1M022hhi</a></p>\n— wta (@WTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1720550896130458062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Serving for the match at 5-3, Sabalenka fought off five break points and converted her fourth match point with a thundering ace.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year in Fort Worth, Sabalenka is looking to become the first player to reach consecutive finals since Serena Williams (2013, 2014).</p>\n<p>“I think I don’t have to compare this WTA Finals to last year,” Sabalenka said. “It’s completely two different tournaments, two different conditions.

    body: '<p>CANCUN, Mexico -- Chris Evert had a confession. She couldn\'t remember the first time she met Martina Navratilova, the woman who would go from being her fiercest rival to greatest confidant. </p>\n<p>She was too busy trying to win a game of backgammon.</p>\n<p>"I remember better than Chris I think, because for her I was just some youngster walking by," Navratilova said at a media conference at the GNP Seguros WTA Finals Cancun. "But she did say hello. But she had no idea who I was. </p>\n<p>It was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1973, Navratilova\'s first-career tournament. "The S&amp;H Green Stamps, the USLTA tour -- because I was not allowed to play the Virginia Slim Tour, which was what I really wanted to play, but the federation wouldn\'t let me," Navratilova said. She navigated the qualifying draw to earn her first main draw appearance.</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n</div><p>While strolling along, she spotted Frank Hammond, the veteran umpire whom she believed also officiated at the tournament. Evert was there, engaged in a game of backgammon. Navratilova, who recalled first reading about Evert\'s existence in an issue of World Tennis Magazine when she was 12, offered a casual greeting and kept going. </p>\n<p>What followed suit was a prolific rivalry that took the women\'s game to the next level. The Evert-Navratilova rivalry was a two-woman show. They faced off 80 times -- 60 of which came in tournament finals -- and left their lives intertwined to this day.</p>\n<p>"I think the moment we became really good friends was the moment we realized that something was bigger than ourselves individually," Evert said. "I think you and I looked at each other after, like, 50 matches. We\'re like, \'Whoa, look at that crowd.\'"</p><div class="articleWidget center">\n\n\n\n</div><p>After the dust settled on their careers, splitting 36 Grand Slam titles between them, their competitive ferocity transformed into an unbreakable, enduring friendship. In January of 2022, <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/2448223/chris-evert-shares-cancer-diagnosis-to-help-others-">Evert was diagnosed with Stage 1C ovarian cancer.</a> One of her first calls went to Navratilova.</p>\n<p>When she got off the phone, Navratilova went to her jewelry box and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/interactive/2023/chris-evert-martina-navratilova-cancer/">put on a Cartier necklace that Evert gifted her</a> for her 60th birthday. Then, in December 2022, <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/3004809/navratilova-diagnosed-with-stage-1-throat-and-breast-cancer">Navratilova was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast and throat cancer</a>. </p>\n<p>"We were always in the trenches when we played matches, and then we\'re in the trenches when we had cancer together," Evert said. "We\'d laugh about that." </p>\n<p>Tennis may be an individual sport, but it takes two to fashion a compelling rivalry. Whether it was the ATP\'s Big Three or the box-office showdowns between the Williams sisters or Serena vs. Maria, rivalries are the spark the sport thrives on. </p>\n<p>Each woman credited the other for unlocking levels in their games and physicality they did not know existed. Evert was the benchmark that Navratilova relentlessly pursued. When Navratilova supplanted her at the top of the game, it was Evert\'s turn to go back to the drawing board. For the first 12 years of the WTA rankings, they were the only two women to finish as year-end No.1s.</p>\n<div id="" class="twitterThumb center" title="Embedded Tweet" contenteditable="false">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">On this day in 1975, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrissieEvert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ChrissieEvert</a> became the first ever <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WTA</a> World No. 1 👏 <a href="https://t.co/VC8mQH4kuP">pic.twitter.com/VC8mQH4kuP</a></p>\n— US Open Tennis (@usopen) <a href="https://twitter.com/usopen/status/1720387845196812319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>"I think you need quality of players and uncertainty of who\'s going to win," Navratilova said, "but you also need the one-on-one conflict that people get excited about. You see on social media, some of the fans, oh my god, they are all in. It\'s like a cult of personalities."</p>\n<p>Surveying the current landscape on tour, Navratilova sees the next big rivalries already bubbling up. </p>\n<p>"We have a bunch of players that are kind of similar age, and moved up in the same time with Elena Rybakina, Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek and, of course, Aryna Sabalenka," she said. "That\'s the core. Then you have Jessica Pegula, Maria Sakkari, all these women nipping at their heels where the way this tour is structured, I think you\'ll see them playing each other more often." </p><div class="articleWidget center">\n</div><p>New installments of the Swiatek and Gauff and the Sabalenka-Rybakina rivalry have already been renewed in Cancun this week. While semifinal qualification still hangs in the balance, No.1 Sabalenka and No.2 Swiatek could meet for a third time this year, potentially with the year-end No.1 on the line.</p>\n<p>"I think Martina brought her own set of fans to the table, and I brought my own set of fans to the table," Evert said. "Even the fans were at each other in the audience. </p>\n<p>The rivalry between Evert and Navratilova was intensified by their contrasting styles and the differences in their personalities. While Navratilova often displayed her emotions openly during matches, Evert maintained a more composed demeanor.</p>\n<p>Additionally, their backgrounds could not have been more divergent, with Navratilova hailing from a communist nation and Evert growing up in the United States. It was this stark contrast that caught the public\'s attention.</p>\n<p>"We brought more eyeballs to the TV and to sports pages and I think that was great," Evert said. "I\'m a big fan of rivalries." </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>',
